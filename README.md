My History Generating Application

This App is an example that was built along with a YouTube video showing how to run my application. The purpose of this application is to help students generate historical people’s death age between the ages of 20 and 100 years. The application compares the age input by the user to famous people’s death age. The application was designed on Android Studio.

 Every part of this project is a sample code which shows how to do the following:
*How to drag various views into the layout from the Palette
*The hierarchy of components in the layout under the Component Tree
*Attributes found on Android Studio
*The code location and layout

Below is a link that demonstrates how to run my app:

The easiest way to understand and have a visual idea on how this application works is to watch the demo video however, here is a short version:
1. Install and open Android Studio
2. Click on the green play icon at the top of your screen
//The device suitable for the design is Pixel 7 Pro API 30
3. Input an age by the Edit Text
4. Generate the history by clicking on "Generate History" button for a result to be displayed
5. Result will be Displayed on the Text View
6. Clear result by clicking on "Clear" button

To design the project, I downloaded Android Studio on the website. Once my App was downloaded, I opened it and created a new Empty Views Activity Project. To configure my project, I named it "MyHistoryGeneratingApp". I used Kotlin language. The minimum SDK for my project was API 24 and clicked finish. I wrote my code under MainActivity.kt. The main design of the application can be found under activity_main.xml.
